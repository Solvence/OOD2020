# Assignment 8

## Features That Work
    All features work as intended by our Providers.
        - Provider's TextualView (command line -view = provider-text) is able to print text representation
          of supplied animation in an adequate fashion.
        - Provider's InteractiveView (command line -view = provider) is able to run an animation 
          and we have created objects for handling user inputs and all necesary features
          needed for last assignment.
          - Pause Button - toggles playing and pausing animation
          - Start Button - plays animation if paused and nothing otherwise

          - Change Speed box - changes speed if given valid (Natural Number not equal to 0) inputs
