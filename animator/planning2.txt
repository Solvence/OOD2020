Changes made:
Create Color class
Create Abstract shape and abstracted duplicate code and fields
Fix BasicAnimatedObject constructor to when given a list of commands, check that building a new
BasicAnimatedObject with these commands is valid.

In Model Interface:
  - Create two new getters getNames() (get all the names of objects in animation) & getCommandsForShape(String name) which will get commands for shape with given name.
  - Get rid of getAnimatedObject as it may reveal too much information which the user wont always need to know.
  - Make getShapesAt -> getShapeAt(String name, int time) as we may not always need to get all the shapes at a given time.

In BAsicTextualView:
Change two string to go threw names of animated objects instead of animatedObjects itself
use getNames and getCommands(String name)
View Interface:
timer, set timer, convert, 
-convert   (ticks -> time interval) maybe
-render

TextualView:
-instead of putting ticks, translate ticks to actual time based on tempo

VisualView (uses Java Swing):
- create base canvas
- render full animation

SVGView:

Builder:




Clarify:
- drawing on negative positions
- getting all essential times for an object or getting all commands for an object
