AnimationModel
-Hashmap<String, Animated>
Methods:
void create(String name, Shape s)
-render(time) // def need time here
void move(String s, int startTime, int endTime, Position end) throws IAE [if interval overlaps with another, or if shape doesnt]
-changeColor(String s, int startTime, int endTime, Color endColor)
-changeSize(...)

Animated object
-Shape field
-commands field
-render
-addcommand
-runcommand
-update

Shape object
-size
-position
-color

interface AnimationObjectCommand
-class changeSize 
-class changeColor
-class move
-canCall

Invariants:
- time cant be negative
- endTime > startTime
- AnimatedObjects commands is always sorted by startTime

Things to consider:
- we used java.awt for Colors despite Amit's warning against it
- We decided to allow the width/height of a Shape to be 0
- Right now, when Shapes are created we require the initial position, color, and size to be
  inputted. This may require much stress on the controller to determine the initial state.

Stuff to mention:
- Added equals for Ellipse
